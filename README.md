## 1. 📌 Project Title / Headline

**Healthcare Operations Dashboard – Built in Power BI**

---

## 2. 🎯 Short Description / Purpose

An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to visualize and analyze hospital inpatient and outpatient records. The dashboard helps healthcare administrators monitor patient volume, departmental load, and operational trends to support data-driven decision-making.

---

## 3. ⚙️ Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
• 📊 **Power BI Desktop** – Primary platform for report building and visualization
• 📂 **Power Query** – Used to clean, reshape, and transform raw hospital data
• 🧠 **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – For creating calculated columns and measures like admission trends, average stay duration, and department-level KPIs
• 📝 **Data Modeling** – Relationships established across tables like patient logs, department info, and visit types for accurate filtering and aggregation
• 📁 **File Format** – `.pbix` for development; `.png` or `.gif` for dashboard previews/screenshots

---

## 4. 🗂️ Data Source

**Source**: Simulated hospital dataset
The dataset includes patient information such as visit type (inpatient/outpatient), department visited, dates of admission/discharge, and treatment flow. The structure allows time-series analysis, department segmentation, and resource planning insights.

## 5. ✨ Features / Highlights

### • Business Problem

Hospitals need real-time visibility into patient traffic and service demands across departments. Manual reports often fail to reveal critical trends like peak load hours, under-utilized departments, or patient flow inefficiencies.

### • Goal of the Dashboard

To deliver an intuitive and interactive Power BI dashboard that:

* Tracks inpatient and outpatient volume over time
* Breaks down departmental performance and patient distribution
* Supports hospital staff in managing capacity, planning resources, and improving care delivery

### • Walkthrough of Key Visuals

* **Total Patient Visits (Card + Trend Line)**: High-level view of combined inpatient and outpatient activity
* **Department-wise Visit Analysis (Bar Chart)**: Compares patient load across medical departments
* **Inpatient vs. Outpatient Trend (Area or Line Chart)**: Displays temporal patterns in visit types
* **Admission & Discharge Flow (Dual Line Charts)**: Highlights flow of admitted vs. discharged patients over time
* **Interactive Filters**: Slicers for visit type, department, and date range to drill into specific data segments
* **KPIs & Alerts**: Displays key metrics such as average daily visits, length of stay, and alerts for high-load areas

### • Business Impact & Insights

* **Improved Capacity Planning**: Helps identify peak days and overburdened departments
* **Better Resource Allocation**: Informs staff deployment and equipment usage
* **Faster Decision-Making**: Enables instant exploration of patient data without manual reporting
* **Enhanced Patient Care**: Facilitates proactive adjustments in hospital operations based on real-time trends
